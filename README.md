# XorEncrypt

This python project is a simple implementation of the xor encryption method. 


## Usage
  File encryption:
  ``` python3 encrypt.py [password] [input_path] [output_path] ```  
  Encrypting a file will require a password, which is then applied to the input to generate a binary file.
  
  File decryption:
  ``` python3 decrypt.py [password] [input_path] [output_path] ```  
  Decrypting a file will require a password, which is then applied to a binary file to generate a text file. Without the correct password, the output will not
  be correct.
